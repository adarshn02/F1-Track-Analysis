# 2024 Formula 1 Minisector Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes telemetry data from 2024 Formula 1 races to compare driver performances in track minisectors. The analysis focuses on identifying where drivers gain or lose time across various track sections. The project uses Python to process and visualize the data, offering insights into performance differences in each sector.

## Features
- **Data Processing**: Clean and preprocess Formula 1 telemetry data for lap-by-lap comparison.
- **Minisector Segmentation**: Divide the track into smaller sections (minisectors) for fine-grained analysis.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Create dynamic graphs and dashboards using libraries like Matplotlib, Plotly, or Dash to explore driver performance across sectors.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Analyze time and speed variations between drivers to determine key performance advantages.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `plotly`, `dash`, `numpy`
  
## Usage
1. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. **Run the Analysis**:
    ```bash
    python analyze_race_data.py
    ```
3. **View Visualizations**:
   Access the interactive dashboard at `http://localhost:8050` after running the script.

## Data
Telemetry data should be sourced from official Formula 1 data providers or third-party sources like Ergast API.

## Future Improvements
- Add predictive modeling to forecast lap times based on previous performance.
- Implement live telemetry streaming for real-time race analysis.
